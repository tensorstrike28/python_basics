'''
Write a function fizzbuzz_twist(n) that:
Takes an integer n
Prints numbers from 1 to n
For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz"
For multiples of both, print "FizzBuzz"
But:
If the number contains a 3, print "Three"
If the number contains a 5, print "Five"
If it contains both â†’ "ThreeFive" (regardless of divisibility)
"ThreeFive" overrides everything
"Three" and "Five" override FizzBuzz
